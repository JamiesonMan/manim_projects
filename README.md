UPDATE: 7/22/2025 that most of these are from the creator of manim library as of now, I plan on coming back and making some cool chess engine/linear algebra visuals.
These are all of my manim projects

Start Date: 5/18/2025

Important commands to remember:

    {ctrl + alt + a}
    manimgl file.py SceneClassName      # This will run the scene in the given file name.

    {ctrl + alt + o}
    manimgl file.py SceneClassName -o   # This will generate the output file {mp4} for the manim file specified at the class name specified.
